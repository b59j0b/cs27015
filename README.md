Guidelines for the Statistics Project (STAT0035/0036) in 2024-2025
INTRODUCTION


What does a   project   involve?A project is a course that allows a student to undertake   a   major piece   of   independent work   under the guidance of   a supervisor. The assessment is based on a written report and an oral   presentation. This   course   is   different   from   other   courses in that the   content   is   determined   to a large extent by the student.   It provides   a   lot   of   freedom   in   choosing what   to   study but on the other hand it requires a lot more independent thought   and   organisational   skills than the   majority   of   courses.   Many   students   find   the   project   more   demanding   than   the   usual lecture   courses.   However   it   is   also more rewarding,   and   a well-executed project   can   give   confidence   and   pride   in   the   results.   It   is   also   something   that   can   be   used   to   demonstrate   ability   to   potential   employers.
Project versionsThere   are   two   versions   of the   course   available:   STAT0035,   which   is   a   30-credit   course,   and   STAT0036,   which   is   a   15-credit   course.   Both   modules   are   associated   with   FHEQ   Level 6   or   Level   7.THE PROJECT
Choosing a topic and   supervisor
If you   decide   or need to   do   a   final year project, you   must   first   find   yourself a topic   and   a   supervisor.
●       A provisional   list   of   projects   will   be   available   (usually   in   the   summer)   before   you   do   your   project.   You   should   discuss   possibilities   for   projects   before   the   start   of   Term   1 of   the   final year.
Undertaking the projectYou should agree a series of   regular meetings   with your supervisor to discuss your   progress. The   frequency   of   these   meetings   may   vary   overtime   depending   on   the   nature   of the   project   and   on   your   other   commitments,   but   most   students   aim   to   meet   with   their   supervisors   every   one   or   two   weeks   during   Terms    1   and   2.   While   such   a   meeting   and   supervision during Terms   1 and 2 are expected to be in person, remote sessions are allowed   upon the agreement between you and your supervisor.
It is important to get started on your   project early in the firstterm, eventhough the deadline   for   the   completed   report   may   seem   a   long   way   off.
The   project   coordinator   will   be   available   to   answer   queries   about   your   project.   Three   workshops will be offered to help with the written report and the oral presentation.


The Christmas vacation can be a good   opportunity to   do   some   concentrated   work   on   your   project. However, you should not leave anything major to be done over the Easter vacation   since (a) you should   be revising for your exams then and (b) if   you do run into problems at   that time it maybe difficult to contact your supervisor. You should aim to have the bulk of   your report written before the Easter break.For   the   STAT0035   Project   you   are   expected   to   undertake   approximately   260   hours   of   study, including   the   preparation   of   the   report. This   equates   to   around   8-10 hours   per   week during   the   term   time   and   vacation   time   available   for   your   project.   The   amount   of time   required should betaken seriously. In particular if   you do not work hard enough in   the first   term you will regret it later. The   STAT0036 project   should   take   approximately   130   hours   of   study.It   is   a   good   idea to write up   the work   that   you   do   as   you   go   along.   Otherwise,   when   you   get   to   the   end   of the   project,   you   may have   forgotten   the   details   of some   of your   earlier   work. It is also a useful way to organise   the work that you have done and can show up gaps   that   need   to   be   filled   before   you   move   on.   If there   is   a   lot   of computing   involved,   it   is   important to keep good records of   what you have done. It is   very   frustrating not   to be   able to reproduce an earlier result.
More formal descriptions of   the courses are in UCL's Module   Catalogue.
Content of   the projectFor your project you should undertake a substantial piece of   work that investigates aspects   of a   particular   problem,   presents   solutions   and   discusses   them   critically   and   coherently.   This   investigation   maybe   purely   via   study   of   books   and   other   sources, but   more   usually   it will involve applying mathematical or statistical techniques to analyse a probability model   or   a   set   of   data.   Through   the   project,   it   is   important   to   develop   and   demonstrate   your   statistical understanding rather than collecting/cleaning data.A   project is not expected to result in 'new discoveries', as would be the case for a   postgraduate thesis. However, you are expected to demonstrate originality in the   compilation   of   your   report   and, for   example, wholesale   copying   of   material   from   books   in undigested form. is not appropriate.
Writing the report
The main output from your   project is the final report, which for STAT0035 projects should   typically be   in   the   range   of   12,000-15,000   words   (excluding   computer   programs,   tables,   graphs   and   other   output).   For   STAT0036   projects   this   should   be   7,000-10,000   words.   These lengths are guidelines, not   prescriptions,   and quality   is more important than quantity.   If   it   looks   like   your   project   will   either   be   very   short   or   very   long   compared   with   the   guideline, discuss it with your supervisor, preferably not at the last minute. Note that over-   length reports will be penalised.
●       You   need   to   think   carefully   about   the   structure   of what   you   are   writing.   In   order   to   make   a   report   of   this   size   readable   you   need   to:


●       break the material down   into   chapters,   sections   and   subsections;
●       make sure that   the   material   in   each   section   fits   together   coherently   and   that   the   section titles etc. are an accurate description   of   the   content;
●       number sections,   figures, tables   and   important   equations   so 代 写Guidelines for the Statistics Project (STAT0035/0036) in 2024-2025C/C++

●       put a   caption below   or   above   each   diagram,   graph   or   figure to   say what   it   is;
●         give a list of   references and   cite   them   correctly.
●       You   should   think   about   the   audience   for   which   you   are   writing.   For   the   project   you   should   attempt to present the material in   a   form   that   you   would   be   able   to   understand   and   assimilate   if   you   were   given   it   by   one   of   your   peers.
●       You need to   attend to   details   in   the   presentation.   Make   sure   the   spelling   and   grammar   are correct. Spell-checkers and grammar-checkers can be used, but ultimately these can   only   be   properly   checked   by   a   careful   reading   of   the   report.   Make   sure   references   are accurate, dates are correct   and   so   on.
●       You need to organise   your   time   during the writing.   If   you produce   a   report   in   the   final   3   days,   it   will   show.   You   may need   to   edit   the   report   many times before   it   is   in   a   fit   state to be submitted. You should give your supervisor the   opportunity to   comment   on   the plan for your report.
●       Before   the    end   of Term   2,   you    should   agree   with   your    supervisor   a   time   frame   for   providing   feedback   on   your   draft   report   (and   presentation   slides).   Some   supervisors   may prefer to provide feedback on one chapter   at   a time;   others   may prefer   to provide feedback on the whole report at once. Either way, you   need   to provide   drafts   in   plenty   of   time for your supervisor to read them (e.g. usually at least two   weeks before   the final   submission   deadline).   In   return,   your   supervisor   will   be   happy   to   provide   you   with   concrete and constructive comments and suggestions for you to revise your draft report   (and   slides).
●       It   might   help   if you   can   benchmark   your   draft    (written   report   and   oral   presentation   slides)   against   the   criteria   listed   in   the   marking   forms   (which   you   can   find   in   the   "Marking scheme" section on Moodle).
Using mathematical word processing softwareThere   is   a   lot   of   software   currently   available   that   may   make   the   writing   up   of   your   project easier   and   it   is   recommended   that   you   spend   some   time   familiarising   yourself with   the   possibilities   at   an   early   stage   of   the   project. You   will   probably   find   that   you   will   need   to revise   the    structure   of   your   report    several   times,    so    software    that   reliably   renumbers   sections is obviously an advantage.Many   word   processors    (for    example    WORD)    will    allow    you    to    organise    and    cross-   reference material as well as to write Greek letters, subscripts and equations. If   your report   is likely to contain many and/or more complicated equations,   you   will   almost   certainly be   better   offusing   the   mathematical   word   processing   package   LaTeX,   which   is   widely   used by   members   of   staff.Whatever   software   and   computer   you   use, remember   to   backup   your   files   regularly.   Disk failures   on   laptops   are   not   all   that   rare, and   WORD   has   an   uncanny   knack   of   knowing   just when it would be most inconvenient to overwrite your file with rubbish.


Help with preparing written reports will be given in the workshops.
The oral presentationIn   the   end   of Term   2,   we   will   hold   a practice   oral presentation.   The   final   (assessed)   oral   presentation will be held   face-to-face in Term   3,   with   slides   submitted   online   in   advance.   The oral presentation will involve your giving a   talk   of   13-15   minutes   about   your project, plus about 5 minutes   of   QA.
Help with preparing and   delivering oral presentations   will be   given   in   the   workshops   and   the practice oral presentation.
Assessment   of   the   project
The project   is   assessed   on the written report   (80%)   and the   oral   presentation   (20%).   (See   the   Moodle   page   of   the   course   for   marking   schemes.)Electronic versions of the written report and the slides of the   final oral   presentation should   be   submitted   in   two   designated   areas   of the   Moodle   page   of the   course   (see   the   Moodle   page   for   the   update   of   information   including   precise   deadlines).
Structure of   the written report
●       Include a frontpage with the title of   your   project, your candidate number, course code   (i.e. STAT0035 or STAT0036), word count, and   date   (e.g. April   2025).
●       The   second page   should   contain   an   Abstract   of   up   to   about   300   words   in   length.   This   is   a   brief statement   of the   aims   of the   project   and   a   guide   to   the   major   results.   It   is   distinct from the Introduction, which gives the background, motivation and aims of   the   study in more detail.
●       Include a   Table   of   Contents   (and possibly   a   Glossary if   appropriate),   a   chapter/section   of   Introduction,   a   chapter/section   of   Conclusions   including   discussion   of   limitations and future work, and a   list   of   references.
●       The reference list should include all references that have been used to support the work   reported, and these references should be cited in the text ofthe report to indicate where   they have been used.
●       There are a   number of   standard   ways of   referencing   books,   articles,   lecture   notes,   software, etc., and you should use one of   these. You   should read the separate guidelines   on referencing and discuss with your supervisor what system   you   are   going to use.
●       The pages   should   be   clearly   numbered   and   should   have   a   left-hand   margin   of at   least   2cm.
●       Examiners   attach   considerable   importance   to   accuracy,   clarity   and   overall   quality   of   presentation. Achieving this means   starting to write   early,   so   that   you   are   not   rushing   to write everything up at the last minute, and giving   your supervisor the opportunity to   give you some feedback in time   for   it   to be useful.
